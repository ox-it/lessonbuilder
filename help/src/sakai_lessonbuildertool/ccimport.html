<h2>Import Common Cartridge</h2>

<a name="top"> </a>

<p> This function allows you to read a file in IMS Common Cartridge
Format. This format is used by content vendors to supply instructional
material, including tests and pages of content. Other course management
systems such as Blackboard can also export the contents of a course
in Common Cartridge format. So this can be used to move content
between course management systems.

<p> Currently Sakai can read Common Cartridge versions 1.0 and 1.1, but
it can't write this format. Writing will be available in a future version.

<p> When you import a Common Cartridge, it can (depending upon the cartridge)
create new pages with content on them, and add tests and forum topics.
It can also create question pools. If it create a question pool, it will only
show up if you go into Tests and Quizes and use "Questions Pools."
