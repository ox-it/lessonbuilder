<h2>Adding Resources to the Page</h2>

<a name="top"> </a>

<p>NOTE: resources and multimedia are similar. Both can be either files or URLs. The 
difference is that resources appear as links in your Lesson Builder page, whereas
multimedia is displayed in a box on the page, if the student's browser is able to do this.</p>

<p>Click <strong>Add Resource</strong> at the top of the page.</p> 
<p>You can add a file to your page by:</p> 
<ul>
  <li>Clicking <strong>Browse...</strong> or <strong>Choose file</strong>  and locating the file on your computer. Click <strong>Save</strong> to complete the process. The file will be added to your page and stored in the Resources tool in a folder with the same title as your Lesson Builder tool.</li>

  <li>Supplying the web address of a file or web page in the <em>URL</em> text box. Click <strong>Save</strong> to complete the process.</li> 

  <li>Clicking <strong>Choose Existing File</strong> to select a file that has already been uploaded to Resources. Select the file that you want to add to your page by clicking <strong>Select</strong>. Complete the process by clicking <strong>Continue</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h5><a name="3.1">Edit a Resource</a></h5>
<p>Click the <strong>Edit</strong> button to the left of the resource you would like to modify.</p>

<p>This will open up an <em>Edit Item</em> box on your screen. The options available for modification are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Item Name</strong> - Change the name of the text on the link to your resource on the main Lesson Builder page.</li>
  <li><strong>Item Description</strong> - Change/add a description to your resource, which will appear beneath the link to the resource.</li>
  <li><strong>Change File or URL</strong> - Change the file being linked to, or the URL if you're using a Web Link.</li>
  <li><strong>Don't Release Item Until All Prerequisites are Completed</strong> - Select this option if you would like it to appear/be accessible only after previously 'Required' items have been completed/accessed.
</li>
  <li><strong>Require This Item </strong>- Select this option to make this item a 'Required' item for later on in the Lesson Builder plan.</li>
  <li><strong>Edit the groups for which this item should be shown </strong> - If you have groups or sections in the site, allows you to make this
item visible only to some groups. Students who are not in one of the checked sections of groups will not see this item on their page at all.</li>

</ul>

<p>To save your changes, click <strong>Update Item</strong>.</p>
<h5><a name="3.2">Delete a Resource</a></h5>

<p>Click <strong>Edit</strong> to the left of the resource you would like to remove, then click <strong>Delete</strong>.</p>
<p>The delete function in Lesson Builder only removes the link on the Lesson Builder page.
If you would like to completely delete an uploaded file from your worksite, the file will also need to be removed from the Resources tool. To do this, click <strong>Resources</strong> on the left menu and click on the folder that has the same title as the Lesson Builder from which the file was removed. Click <strong>Actions --> Remove</strong> to the right of the file. Click <strong>Remove</strong> to complete the process.</p>

<h5><a name="3.2">Access Controls for Resource</a></h5>

<p> When you select <b>Don't Release Item Until All Prerequisites are Completed</b>, Lesson Builder will
control students' access to the resource. The resource is hidden so that it can only be accessed through
Lesson Builder. If the resource involved is a web document (HTML), there are special considerations.
Web documents often include images, and they can refer to other documents. Thus controlling the document
itself may not be good enough. When you control a web document, Lesson Builder will attempt to 
identify a folder in which images and other files referred to in the document may reside. It will
control access to that entire folder. If the file is called index.html, index.htm, player.html,
or NAME.html, where NAME is the name of the folder it is in, then the folder that the document is
in will be controlled. If not, and there is a folder by the name as the document, that folder
will also be controlled. That is, if you have a file FILE.html, and there is also a folder in
the same place called just FILE, FILE will be controlled as well as FILE.html.

<p> By controlled, it means that access to the folder will be hidden so that access is only possible
through Lesson Builder, and access to everything in that folder is availablel at the some time that
the web document is available.
