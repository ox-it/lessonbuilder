<h2>Student Content </h2>

<a name="top"> </a>

<p> "Add Student Content" will insert a tool that permits students to add pages of their
own. Those pages look much like regular Lesson Builder pages, although there are
fewer options. This allows students to share material with the rest of the class.
There is an option to permit other students to comment on their work.</p>

<p> Small icons appear to the left of the point for each student's page.
The icons show which entries are new, and which contain new content or new
comments.</p>

<h5><a name="2.1">Edit</a></h5>

<p>The Edit button will allow you to change certain details about the
comment tool. This includes the following:

<ul>
<li> <strong>Make These Student Pages Anonymous</strong> - The author of the page
will not be shown, except to the instructor.</li>

<li> <strong>Add a Comments Section to Each Page</strong> - Places a comments
tool at the bottom of each page, allowing other students to comment on the work.</li>

<li> <strong>Make These Comments Anonymous</strong> - The author of the comments
will not be shown, except to the instructor.</li>

  <li><strong>Don't Release Item Until All Prerequisites are Completed</strong> - Select this option if you would like the student contents section to be  accessible only after previously 'Required' items have been completed/accessed.
</li>
  <li><strong>Require This Item </strong>- Select this option to make this item a 'Required' item for later on in the Lesson Builder plan. The requirement will be satified once someone has added added a page with at least some content.</li>
  <li><strong>Edit the groups for which this item should be shown </strong> - If you have groups or sections in the site, allows you to make the student content block
visible only to some groups. Students who are not in one of the checked sections of groups will not see this item on their page at all.</li>
</ul>
<p>To save your changes, click <strong>Update Item</strong>.</p>
<p> The <strong>Delete option</strong> may be used to delete the student block from the page. Note that
the student pages themselves remain in the database, although only an administrator will be able to retrieve them.</p>
<p> Note that when a student uploads a file through a student page, it is normally put into the
resources area of their workspace. Lesson Builder will give authorized readers of the page access to any
file that is listed in the student's page,
even if it wouldn't normally be visible to others.
