<h2>Add Content From Another Web Site (ZIP file)</h2>

<a name="top"> </a>

<p> This function allows you to load a file in ZIP format. It normally
contains a set of pages from another web site. There is special support
for ZIP files produced by Camtasia, Wimba Create, and Articulate.</p>

<p>Use the "Add Content" pull-down and choose <strong>Add Website</strong>.</p> 

<p> If Lessons recognizes the file format, it will add a link to 
the main web page in the file. This file is often called index.html
or index.htm. However Camtasia, Wimba Create, and Articulate have
special ways of entering them, which Lessons will recognize.</p>

<p> The file contained in the ZIP file are loaded into a new folder in Resources.</p>

<p> The "Add website" dialog allows you to specify a file. If you do it will 
be uploaded and processed. However you can also choose a ZIP file is already
present in the Resources tool. If you do that, Lessons will read the ZIP archive,
extract all files in it, and add them as if you had uploaded the ZIP file.</p>

<p> This function depends upon features in the Sakai kernel. It may not appear for
older versions of Sakai. </p>
