For lesson builder we need to patch sakairsf. Unfortunately Fluid
hasn't put up the full source. So I've extraced the source from the
jar. Unfortunately when I build it, the result doesn't work. Hence I
do a build, and then starting with the original jar, patch in just the
one class that has changed.

The result is sakairsf-0.7.4-sakai-rutgers_2.2.x.jar

pom.xml for lesson builder actually gets that jar from a repository at
Rutgers, so you shouldn't need to do this, but since this is supposed
to be an open source project, I'm supplying what you need to duplicate
it if you have to.
