SHOWPAGE

The guts of the system are ShowPage.html, ShowPageProducer.java and
show-page.js.  There is a separate file, which should only be read
after you've read this one, talking about it.

NAMES INVOLVING SIMPLEPAGE

You'll see some class names starting with SimplePage. Lesson Builder
started out as a copy of the SimplePage tool. All the database tables
and everything else external were updated, but we didn't have time to
go back and fix up all the code. Because the class names are all in
Lesson Builder packages, there should be no conflict with the original
Simple Page tool, should you use both.

BASIC STRUCTURE

Lesson Builder has quite simple data structures. 

* SimplePage - this is a page, as shown in the UI. It has items on it.
   the key field for a page is its ID number.
* SimplePageItem - this represents one thing on a page, e.g. a resource,
   test, assignment, etc. The key fields for an item are the id number
   and the thing it points to. There's a type code, e.g. RESOURCE or 
   ASSIGNMENT, and a SakaiID, which is normally a reference, e.g.
   /assignment/23. The type code is the same for all tools of the
   type. I.e. ASSESSMENT is used for both Samigo and Mneme. The
   reference has the actual tool name.
* SimplePageLogEntry - we keep an entry for each user and each page.
   While we currently only create log entrie for pages, the record
   has an item number. Note that in some cases you can get to a page 
   in more than one way, because several pages can point to the
   same page. It turns out that we need to do bookkeeping separately
   for each. By using the item number, the log entry is specific to the
   way we got to the page.
      The log entry shows the first and last times they went 
   to the page. Complete indicates whether they've completed all required
   items on the page. Then there are a couple of weird fields: path is 
   used so that when we log off and log on, we can get back to the state
   we were in. We need to know not just what page the user was on before,
   but the way they got to it, so we can put back the right breadcrumbs.
   So every time the user accesses a page, we not only update the last
   access time, but the path (i.e. breadcrumbs). Dummy is used for
   a page that the user hasn't accessed but is authorized to because
   he's completed all the prerequisites. Normally there wouldn't be
   a log entry for something the user hasn't visited, but to avoid
   lots of recomputation, when we know a user can access the page
   but hasn't done so yet, we make a dummy log entry. (Implicit in
   this is that if a user has accessed a page before, he's allowed to
   access the page. Hence if there's a log entry for a page, we don't
   have to check whether the user has met the prrequesites. Since pages
   can chain off each other, checking the whole chain of prerequistes
   each time would be impractical, and maybe even impossible.)
* SimplePageGroup is used to keep track of the Sakai groups we create
   to control access to tests and assignments. Because these tools are
   group-aware, when access is restricted to a test, we create a group
   for the test, and set the test to only be available to members of
   that group. As people meet the prerequeists for the test, we add them
   to the group. We can only do this for some tools, currently Samigo,
   Assignment, and I believe jForum.
   
The main classes are
 ShowPageProducer - displays the main user page. Mostly UI code
 SimplePageBean - has most of the "business logic" for ShowPageProducer,
    although other UI code can and does use it as well. There's
    a detailed description of what it does in comments at the beginning
 SimplePageToolDao/Impl - all access to the database goes through here
    please don't access it except through this class

Before you do any significant work, please read the comments at the
beginning of these three classes, and probaby also look at the data
structures listed above. It's particularly important to understand
the security model, so you don't create holes. That is documented in
the comments at the beginning of these three classes.

CHANGE IN FUNCTION OF PARENT and TOP FIELDS IN SIMPLEPAGE

In the pages (SimplePage), there are two fields that are no longer
used: parent and top. The original design was for pages and subpages,
i.e. a strict hiearchy of pages. Thus pages have the ID number of
their parent and the top level page for their tool.

However I've moved to a general mesh of pages. So those fields no
longer mean much. They are only actually used to tell which pages are
top-level, i.e. they show in the left margin. Pages that are top level
have a null parent. At this point I'm using an ID number of 0 for the
parent of everything else.

The way pages now work is that each is pretty much independent. What
differentiates a subpage is that another page has an item of type PAGE
that points to it. The same page can actually be pointed to from
several different places. A page can even be both a top-level page
and a subpage. I.e. it can appear in the left margin and other pages
can also point to it. In that case it has a null parent to show that
it's a top-level page. 

There's a notional site-wide page which is the parent of all the
top-level pages. By that I mean that there's an item entry pointing to
each top-level page. These are the items that would appear in the
site-wide page if it existed.

I actually had a sort of embarrassing bug. Since the code for copying
pages assumed a hierarchy, it just did a recursive descent. The first
time in the new structure I had two pages pointing to each other, that
code blew the stack. At this point the export files don't have any
hierarchy in them. They start with a list of pages, and then for each
page the items in it. When something is a subpage that fact shows
because there's an item in another page pointing to it. This
generality means that I have to generate all the pages in the new
site, making up a hash table from ID number in old site to ID number
in new site. Then I go back and fill in the items. When one of the
items is another page, I use the hash table to find the ID number in
the new site. I can still read old export files, but I ignore the
hierarchical structure in them.

HOW LESSON BUILDER PAGES CONNECT TO THE REST OF SAKAI

Sakai is organized into tools and pages. A page is something in the
left margin. Each page can have more than one tool on it. For Lesson
Builder that would be unusual. Page in this context is a Sakai page.
It has nothing to do with Lesson Builder pages. I refer to it as "site
page" in the few places in the code where it appears.

To find the top level Lesson Builder page for a tool, we look for a
page that has the right toolID and a parent page ID that is null
(meaning it's a top level page.) As noted above, at this point all the
parent page ID is used for is identifying top level pages by the fact
that their parent is null. toolid's used to be used for all pages, but
since pages can now move around, only the top-level page is currently
associated with a tool. Thus the toolId field in SimplePage is really
only useful for parent==null. (This means that a given Lesson Builder
page can only appear once in the left margin. I don't think that's a
serious restriction.)

Note that when you create a new instance of Lesson Builder in the Site
Info tools dialog, Sakai makes a site page and tool, but doesn't
create any Lesson Builder entities at all. The first time the tool is
invoked, ShowPageProducer is called (because RSF is told that it's the
default view for Lesson Builder). Normally ShowPageProducer is passed
a parameter of SendingPage to tell it what page to go to. But when
Sakai calls ShowPageProducer, obviously there's no such argument,
since Sakai knows nothing about Lesson Builder's structures. So when
ShowPageProducer isn't passed a sendingpage,
SimplePageBean.getCurrentPageId will note this fact, and ask the Sakai
session manager to find the current Sakai tool. It will then locate
the top level page for that tool by looking for a page with nulll
parent and the right tool ID.

If this is the first time ShowPageProducer has been called for this
tool, SimplePageBean will create the top-level page, and also the
top-level item pointing to it from the notional (but non-existent)
site-wide page.

CHANGE IN FORMAT OF SAKAIID in ITEMS

Items have a type and a SakeiId. Originally the type was something
like SmplePageItem.ASSIGNMENT and the SakaiID was the assignment ID
number. However the moment we got to more than one assignment tool,
this wasn't the right approach. SakaiId needs to be a reference, e.g.
"/assignment/ID" or "/assignment2/ID". So the item type is the generic
type e.g. assignment, but actual implementation type (assignment of
assignment 2) is in the reference. By separating things in this way we
could in principle deal with a tool (e.g. Mneme) that can handle both
assignments and quizes. The SakaiID would use the tool name, while the
item type field would indicate whether Lesson Builder thinks it's an
assignment or a quiz.

Newly created items will all use the reference format for the SakaiID.
However old database entries may not. So if we find a SakaiID that is
a simple number, we assume it's a reference to the original tool used
for that type (i.e. Assignment, Samigo, or jForum).

Note that there's another special SakaiID, SimplePageItem.DUMMY. This
is used for dummy references. When you copy a site, we can't copy the
actual references to test, assignment, etc (because of issues in how
the copy code works). So we produce dummy references. The display code
knows to display them with a note telling the author to choose an
actual test, assignment, etc.

THE URL ITEM TYPE

There's a URL type. Currently I'm not using it. When an item refers to
a URL, I actually create a URL item in Resources. So it looks like any
other resource. This may be a mistake. I've considered going back and
using raw URL's. The main reason I haven't is that this approach
causes all access to go through Resources, so Event log entries are
made, and I have the potential for doing access control in resources
if I ever want to.
