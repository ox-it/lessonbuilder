<h2> ACCESSIBILITY</h2>

<p> When creating content, consider the needs of people with disabilities.

<p> There is a good deal of information about creating web content for
accessibility. One example of this is WebAIM's, 
<a href="http://webaim.org/intro/" target="_blank">Introduction to Web Accessibility</a>.

<p> Lesson Builder has
several features to help you create accessible content:

<h3> Images </h3>

<p> Images should generally include an "ALT tag", a textual description of
the image. However images that are there for decoration, to
add blank space, etc., should generally have blank ALT tags.

<p> After adding an image using "Add Multimedia",
the "Edit" button will let you add ALT text.

<p> If you insert an image in "Add Text", using
the web editor, the "Image" dialog
also makes provisions to supply ALT text.

<h3> Multimedia Content </h3>

<p> When you use multimedia content, generally you should provide
alternative ways of getting the content, at least some of which
are appropriate for use with screen readers.

<p> In Lesson Builder there are several ways to provide
alternative content. The simplest is to add a description
underneath the content. After adding content with "Add Multimedia",
the "Edit" button will let you add a description field under
the content.

<p> If a brief description isn't enough, consider using
"Add Subpage" to create a page with more extensive alternative content, or 
using "Add Resource" to point to an existing resource.
